# Ma412_Final_Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of unsupervised clustering techniques applied to a dataset of aircraft trajectories. The goal is to group the examples in the dataset based on their features. 

## Dataset

We have a database ‘data.npy’ that contains 3879 examples with 18 features each. Each
example corresponds to an aircraft trajectory with its position in the sky and other significant
features.
